# Dual Axis Solar Tracker

## Project Objective
The aim of this project was to develop a laboratory prototype of a solar tracking system. This system seeks to enhance the performance of photovoltaic modules by keeping them constantly aligned with the sunbeams, thus maximizing exposure to sunlight and increasing the solar panel's output power.

## Project Description
- Designed and implemented a hardware system with a microcontroller to control the motion of the solar panel.
- Programmed the microcontroller using Arduino IDE to adjust the solar panel based on inputs from light sensors.
- Conducted simulations using Tinkercad and performed necessary design and torque calculations.
- Assembled the physical model and conducted tests to ensure the functionality of the system.

## Technologies and Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: ATmega328P (Arduino Uno)
- **Sensors**: Four Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to detect sunlight intensity.
- **Actuators**: Two servo motors for dual-axis rotation.
- **Additional Components**: Breadboard, resistors, and solar panels.

## Performance Metrics
- **Torque Requirement**: 1.914 kg-cm for the motor.
- **Power Consumption**: Each servo motor consumes 10W, totaling 20W for two motors.
- **Power Produced**: The solar panels produce a total of 3.6W.

## Key Learnings and Insights
